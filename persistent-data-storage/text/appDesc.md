This app is a demonstration of how to store data from a shiny app in a *persistent* way so that the data can be retrieved again later.  

The app is meant to serve as a supplement to a guide on persistent data storage that can be found [here]().  

In this app, the data that is saved and restored is user-submitted responses to a form. This is a practical use case of saving data from a shiny app. For a guide on how to build a form with shiny that focuses more on the form than on the storage mechanism, see [this article]().  

The complete code for this app is [on GitHub](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server/tree/master/persistent-data-storage).  
This app was created by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com).
